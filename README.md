## 4.Dos and Don'ts

2. Try to keep detail short and simple enough to describe the title.
3. A label with empty tasks will be automatically deleted.
4. Titles and labels are case sensitive i.e.. Hello â‰  HELLO.
5. If Two Tasks/Labels with same text/name exists then the one created first will be displayed.
6. Escape characters like ```\n``` and ```\t``` can be used to decorate.

## 5.Commands
1. ```iscompleted:``` if this command is entered in the search box, only the completed tasks from a specific label will appear.
2. ```isimportant:``` if this command is entered in the search box, only the important tasks from a specific label will appear.
3. ```isnotimportant:``` if this command is entered in the search box, only the non-important tasks from a specific label will appear.
